// The preferred way to build ADVi3++ is with PlatformIO. With PlatformIO, you can easily build BLTouch and non-BLtouch releases.
// If for whatever reason, you prefer to use Arduino IDE, uncomment the following line to build a BLTouch release.
#define ADVi3PP_BLTOUCH

// To log the content of frames, uncomment the following line
//#define ADVi3PP_LOG_FRAMES
